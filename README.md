# Robtic System

Robtic System is a modular Discord automation platform designed for developer communities.
It provides a scalable bot ecosystem where multiple specialized bots operate under a single main controller.

## Overview

The system is built to manage community operations, staff workflows, moderation, and service access in a structured and automated way.

A central **Main Bot** controls and coordinates several functional bots, allowing administrators to enable or disable modules as needed.

## Core Components

* **Main Bot** – system controller, configuration manager, advertisement system, and partner server management
* **Moderation Bot** – moderation tools, punishment logging, and the ticket system
* **HR Bot** – staff management, recruitment, and promotions
* **ModMail Bot** – private communication between users and staff
* **Community Bot** – XP, activity tracking, and progression roles
* **Dev Bot** – development and testing

## Key Features

* Modular bot architecture
* Centralized system control
* Ticket and modmail systems
* Staff management automation
* Activity and role progression system
* Advertisement ordering and management
