/**
 * Resolves a player's premium tier, and with it every limit the survival features enforce.
 *
 * <h2>Premium is the one thing Discord still decides</h2>
 *
 * A staff rank is a LuckPerms group the game server owns, mirrored outwards to Discord. Premium is
 * the opposite: it is bought and managed on Discord, so the role is genuinely the source and the
 * LuckPerms group follows it.
 *
 * The two never collide because the sets are disjoint — the staff mirror only touches role ids
 * named in roles.yml, and premium sync only touches the groups named in premium.yml. Keeping them
 * that way is a configuration rule, and it is worth stating: putting a staff rank's group in a
 * premium tier would make the two write the same state again.
 *
 * <h2>Every limit lives here</h2>
 *
 * Homes, `/back` uses, locked chests, the portable chest and the cosmetics all read their limit
 * from {@link entitlementsOf}. No feature carries its own copy, so raising a tier's home limit is
 * one edit rather than four.
