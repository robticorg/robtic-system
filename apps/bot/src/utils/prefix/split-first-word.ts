 * Takes the next positional token off an argument string.
 *
 * A quoted run counts as one token: `!shortcut add "points balance" c` gives `points balance` and
 * `c`. Without that, any option whose value contains a space is unusable unless it happens to be
 * the last string option — which is what made `shortcut add` impossible to drive from chat, since
 * its first option is a command path like `warn add`.
 *
 * Smart quotes are accepted because phones substitute them silently, and someone whose shortcut
 * quietly broke has no way to see why.
 *
 * An unterminated quote falls back to splitting on whitespace rather than swallowing the rest of
 * the message: a stray apostrophe in `it's` must not eat every remaining argument.
