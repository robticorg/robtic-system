 * The activity economy: Points earned by participating, and RC converted from them.

 * Points are the Discord-side currency every activity system pays into — messages, combo, streak,
 * voice, and whatever is added next.
 *
 * `default-on`: members accrue Points from activity that is already happening, and nothing is
 * spent or announced without someone asking for it.
