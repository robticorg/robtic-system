/**
 * Awards one tick's worth of XP and Points for time spent in voice.
 *
 * Voice has its own level (`voiceLevel`) on the same curve as chat — same randomXP range, same level maths, same rewards
 * and announcement machinery, but only voice XP raises it. It writes through
 * `addVoiceXP` rather than `addXP` so voice time does not inflate the message counters.
 *
 * The message-XP cooldown and the AI meaningfulness check are deliberately skipped: the tick is
 * already once a minute, and there is no message to judge. Voice has its own gates — AFK, the AFK
 * channel, and the alone multiplier.
