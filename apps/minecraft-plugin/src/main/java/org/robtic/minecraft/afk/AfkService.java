/**
 * The AFK lobby: detecting inactivity, moving players, and putting them back.
 *
 * <h2>All of the behaviour lives here</h2>
 *
 * The listeners do one thing — call {@link #touch(UUID)} — and every decision about what that means
 * is made in this class. That is what keeps "should this player be moved?" answerable in one place
 * rather than spread across a dozen event handlers.
 *
 * <h2>Cost</h2>
 *
 * Recording activity is a map write of a long, which is what makes it affordable on
 * {@code PlayerMoveEvent}. Nothing is scanned per tick: one task sweeps every
 * {@code check-interval-ticks} (5 seconds by default) and only players idle beyond the timeout are
 * touched at all.
 *
 * <h2>Durability</h2>
 *
 * A player who disconnects while AFK would otherwise have their real position lost — the server
 * saves them where they are, which is the lobby. Snapshots are therefore written to
 * {@code afk-state.yml} and restored on rejoin, so a restart mid-AFK strands nobody.
 *
 * <h2>Settlement</h2>
 *
 * A session is paid for exactly once, by {@link AfkRewardService}, at one of three moments: coming
 * back, disconnecting, or the server stopping. Every one of those routes through
 * {@link #settle(UUID, String, AfkSnapshot, boolean)}, and the snapshot it settles is marked so a
 * second attempt on the same session — a disconnect followed by the restore on the next join — pays
 * nothing. Nothing else writes, and nothing writes on a timer.
