/**
 * What being AFK is worth, and the one write that records it.
 *
 * <h2>Nothing accrues; everything is derived</h2>
 *
 * There is no task ticking a counter and no periodic write. A session is a start timestamp held in
 * {@link AfkSnapshot}, and what it has earned at any instant is
 * {@code (now - start) / 3600000 * robs-per-hour} — a function, evaluated when somebody asks. A
 * player standing in the AFK world for six hours therefore costs this plugin nothing at all until
 * the moment they stop, at which point it costs exactly one request.
 *
 * That is also why the reward is not in the cache. Storing "robs earned so far" would create a
 * second number that has to be kept in step with the clock, which is the thing a timer would exist
 * to do; deriving it means there is nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * <h2>The totals are cached, the session is not</h2>
 *
 * Lifetime and daily figures come from the API on join, move forward locally when a session is
 * settled, and are re-read from the settlement's own response. Everything that renders them — the
 * profile GUI, the placeholders — reads this map and never the network, which is what lets a tab
 * list ask for {@code %robtic_afk_total%} once a second.

     * shortfall was carried in a rounding residue that worked within a session and was thrown away by
     * every restart.

     * Robs now carry two decimal places, so the residue is gone and there is nothing to carry: the
     * session pays 0.83 and the player sees 0.83.
