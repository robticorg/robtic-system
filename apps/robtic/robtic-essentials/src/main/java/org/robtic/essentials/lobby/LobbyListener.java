/**
 * Detects entering and leaving the lobby, and captures the survival inventory on the way out.
 *
 * <h2>Three events, one decision</h2>
 *
 * Join, world change and respawn can each land a player in the lobby, and each has to produce the
 * same outcome. They all funnel into {@link #evaluate}, which compares the world against the
 * configured lobby and calls the manager — so there is one definition of "entered the lobby"
 * rather than three that drift apart.
 *
 * <h2>Why the inventory is captured here</h2>
 *
 * The lobby previews the survival inventory, but by the time a player is standing in the lobby
 * Multiverse-Inventories has already swapped it away. The last moment it is both current and in
 * memory is the world-change event *out of* a survival world, which is where this captures it.
 *
 * "Survival world" is {@link LobbyConfiguration#isSurvivalWorld}, not "not the lobby" — Spawn and
 * every other non-Survival world (an event arena, an admin world, and so on) must never be able to
 * overwrite the Survival snapshot with their own per-world inventory on the way out.
 *
 * The capture is read-only in every sense: it is never restored, never written back to a world, and
 * read only by the preview menu. Restoring inventories remains Multiverse-Inventories' job.
