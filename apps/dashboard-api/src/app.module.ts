/**
 * The composition root, and nothing else.
 *
 * It declares no controller and no feature provider of its own — every one of those now belongs to
 * the module that owns it. What was here before was a flat list of six controllers and a service,
 * which meant adding a feature meant editing this file, and reading this file told you nothing about
 * how the features related.
 *
 * Import order is the dependency order: configuration must resolve before anything reads it, and
 * AuthModule must be constructed before the feature modules whose controllers reference its guards.
 * Both are `@Global()`, which is what lets the feature modules below declare no imports at all.
