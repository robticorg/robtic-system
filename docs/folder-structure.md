## Conventions

- Folders: lowercase. Files: kebab-case. Functions: camelCase. Types/interfaces/enums: PascalCase. Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
- Feature-based organization inside each bot: `commands/`, `events/`, `components/`, `services/`, `utils/`.
- `index.ts` barrels only where they genuinely shorten imports (`@core/config`, `@core/libs`, `@database/repositories`, `@database/models`).
