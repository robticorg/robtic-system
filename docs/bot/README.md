# Bot Documentation

`apps/bot` is one Discord bot — one token, one gateway connection, one command tree.

Big systems live in `features/<key>/`, each owning its commands, events, components and prefix
form, and each switchable per guild with `/feature`. Smaller commands sit under `commands/` in the
scope tree (`global/`, `guild/{admin,general,games}/`, `admin/`). See
[architecture.md](../architecture.md) for the loader rules and the bar a system has to clear to
become a feature.

| System | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| points | `features/points/` | Activity points + RC premium currency — on by default |
| combo | `features/combo/` | Two-user conversation scoring — on by default |
| top | `features/top/` | Cross-category leaderboard panel — on by default |
| logging | `features/logging/` | Log channel routing — on by default |
| panels | `features/panels/` | Reusable message panels — on by default |
| shortcuts | `features/shortcuts/` | Custom message triggers — on by default |
| voice | `features/voice/` | Voice XP and time tracking — opt-in per guild |
| streak | `features/streak/` | Daily message streaks — opt-in per guild |
| invites | `features/invites/` | Invite tracking, join announcements, `/invites` and `/info` — on by default |
| partner | `features/partner/` | Partner servers and their banner posts — on by default |
| moderation | `commands/guild/admin/moderation/` | Punishments, audit logging, security rules |
| configuration | `commands/guild/admin/` | Prefix, roles, channels, panels, XP, shortcuts |
| minecraft | `commands/guild/games/` | Linking, shared economy, chat bridge, LuckPerms sync |
| member-facing | `commands/guild/general/` | Profile, level, help, notes |
| cross-server | `commands/global/` | Version |
| bot operator | `commands/admin/` | Server allowlist, super users, reload, admin guild |

Command names are unique across the whole tree — two systems cannot both register `/mod`, and the
loader reports a collision rather than letting one silently overwrite the other.
