# Development

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.1.0
- MongoDB (local instance or connection string)
- A Discord bot token

## Setup

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in MONGODB_URI and the bot token
```

Non-production runs read the token from `TestBot` instead of `MainBotToken` (see `libs/config/src/bot-definitions.ts`).

The bot leaves any server that is not on the whitelist. A fresh database is seeded with the
permanent Robtic servers (`libs/constants/src/allowed-guilds.ts`); add your test server with
`!guild <serverid> add` (bot owner or super user; the server's own prefix) from one that is already
allowed, before inviting the bot to it. `!guild <serverid> remove` takes it off.

## Commands

All commands run from the repository root (asset paths are cwd-relative):

```bash
bun run dev          # watch mode with Bun preload shim
bun run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit over apps/ and libs/
bun run build        # CI check: bundles the Gateway, worker and Invites API entry points (packages stay external)
bun run start        # run the Gateway in production mode, from source — exactly what the Docker image runs
```

## Workspaces

The repo uses Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `libs/*`). Dependencies are currently hoisted to the root `package.json`; workspace manifests declare identity only. Adding a dependency: add it at the root until per-package dependency ownership lands (see `docs/roadmap.md`).

## Adding a Command / Event / Component

Name the file for what it is — `*.command.ts`, `*.event.ts`, `*.component.ts` or `*.message.ts` —
and put it wherever it belongs: inside a `features/<key>/` folder, or under `commands/` in the
scope tree (`global/`, `guild/{admin,general,games}/`, `admin/`). The loader walks
`apps/bot/src` once and picks it up by name, with no registration list to edit.

Set `scope` and `access` on the command. `scope: "admin"` restricts it to super users and publishes
it only to the guild set with `!admin-guild`; `access: "admin"` restricts a guild command to server
administrators and the roles added with `/command-access admin-roles`.

Slash commands re-register on client ready. `/system reload` re-registers from disk without a
restart, but Bun caches modules, so it will not pick up *edited* source — restart for that.

A system earns its own `features/` folder once it has at least two of: subcommands, gateway events,
two or more components, a scheduler. See [architecture.md](./architecture.md).

## Monitors

`scripts/monitor/` contains PM2-based crash and memory monitors run outside the main process; they import status reporting from `libs/core` by relative path and are not part of the typecheck program.
