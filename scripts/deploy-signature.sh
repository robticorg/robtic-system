# `git ls-files` selects the tracked files, `git hash-object --stdin-paths` hashes each one. Three
# properties come out of that pairing, and all three are load-bearing:
#
#   - **Tracked only.** Untracked and ignored files are invisible here exactly as they are to the
#     Docker build after .dockerignore.
#   - **Working tree, not the index.** `ls-files -s` would print the *staged* blob hash, so an
#     unstaged edit would read as "nothing changed" — the one direction this must never fail in.
#   - **Normalised.** hash-object applies the same filters as a commit, so a CRLF checkout on
#     Windows produces the same signature as an LF checkout on the runner. Hashing raw bytes off
#     disk does not, and every signature would shift the first time a machine with different line
#     endings ran this.
#
# Paths are hashed alongside the contents, so moving a file changes the signature even when nothing
# was edited. Both lists come out in the same sorted order, so the pairing is stable.
#
# Filtered to files that exist on disk. `git ls-files` reports what is tracked, which still includes
# a file deleted in the working tree but not yet committed — hash-object then fails on it and takes
# the whole script with it under `set -e`. On a CI checkout every tracked file exists, so this
# changes no signature there; it only stops a local run dying mid-edit.
